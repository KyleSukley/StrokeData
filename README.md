The project makes use of a dataset from Kaggle, with the goal of predicting binary stroke outcomes. There is an extensive EDA, and sufficient data preparation via sklearn pipelines and column transformers. 

I tested three models:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Linear SVM
3. RandomForestClassifier

I performed a Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), and used the “out-of-the-box” models. I did not tune the hyperparameters, which will be needed to improve results.
